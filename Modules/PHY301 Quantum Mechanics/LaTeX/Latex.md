The question you're asking relates to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics, which states that you cannot simultaneously know the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely one property is measured, the less precisely the other can be controlled, known, or measured.

According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is subject to the condition:

\[ \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \]

where \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant, approximately \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \) Js.

For an E. coli bacterium:

- The uncertainty in position \( \Delta x \) is given to be on the order of nanometers (10^-9 meters).
- The uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) is desired to be within 1/100 of the bacterium's momentum.

First, let's calculate the bacterium's momentum. Momentum (p) is mass (m) times velocity (v):

\[ p = m \cdot v \]

Given:
\[ m = 10^{-11} \text{ grams} = 10^{-14} \text{ kilograms} \] (since 1 gram = 10^-3 kilograms)
\[ v = 3 \times 10^{-5} \text{ meters per second} \]

Let's calculate the momentum and then apply the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle to find out if the simultaneous measurement to the given precisions is possible.

It appears there was an issue with the calculation. However, I can provide you with the approach to manually check whether it's possible to measure both the position and momentum of the bacterium to the desired accuracy.

First, calculate the bacterium's momentum using the formula \( p = mv \), where \( m \) is the mass and \( v \) is the velocity. Given that the mass \( m \) is \( 10^{-14} \) kg (converting from grams to kilograms) and the velocity \( v \) is \( 3 \times 10^{-5} \) m/s, the momentum \( p \) can be calculated.

Then, determine the desired uncertainty in momentum, which would be \( 1/100 \) of the calculated momentum.

Next, using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle \( \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} \), where \( \Delta x \) is the uncertainty in position (given as 1 nm or \( 10^{-9} \) m), calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) that corresponds to this position uncertainty.

Compare the desired uncertainty in momentum to the minimum uncertainty given by the principle. If the desired uncertainty is greater than or equal to the minimum uncertainty, then the measurement is theoretically possible.

If you would like to perform these calculations manually or have me attempt them again, please let me know.
